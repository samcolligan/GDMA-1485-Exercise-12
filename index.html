			<h1>The Art of Listening with Berlin-based<br><span>DJ Alexandra Dröner</span></h1>
			
			<div>
				<p>Snapping her fingers, Alexandra Dröner starts immersing herself in the pulsating beat of the electronic grime music emitted from her DJ console and monitors.</p>

			<p>Rays of sunshine pour in, framing her sharp, innate movements with a cross of light. Her raw, unadulterated motions contrast the refined midcentury furniture of her Prenzlauer Berg loft apartment. Here, in her personal space, the stereo is the focal point: &quot;It’s a temple to me, a wonderful music shrine. I want to be able to sit down or stand in the most ideal position possible and listen to music,&quot; says Dröner. &quot;For me, that’s how music should be experienced at home—as a singular experience and not as background noise.&quot;Dröner wants to feel comfortable when listening to music; clarity and warmth are the most important elements to her—with a focus on midrange and bass rather than on extreme highs.</p>
			
			<p>Dröner enjoys blending together a wide spectrum of artists and sounds; many are reminiscent of the mixes she created as one half of the DJ duo Sick Girls, others transport you back to the original tracks that were their buildings blocks. She mentions Morton Feldman, Arvo Pärt, and another of her favorite composers, György Ligeti. On this sunny morning, she puts on ‘This is How We Walk on the Moon’ by Arthur Russell, a song that deeply touches her over and over again. Russell, who was an American musician and producer, died of an HIV-related-infection in 1992. He was a key artist of his generation and, to Dröner, her grief over this loss is embodied in this song—as is the excitement about the oeuvre that he left behind: “The simple beauty of the instrumentalization, the genius of this wonderful musician, the unfathomable sorrow. All that resonates in emotions excitement and pain—the bittersweet. This is perhaps one of the most powerful feelings that music can evoke,” she says.</p>
			
			<p>Dröner’s interest in audiophilia developed slowly over time. She got her musical education in the Berlin club scene of the nineties and noughties. The scene’s legendary and mythical techno genesis is told extensively in the internationally published book The Sound of Family by Felix Denk. Dröner herself comes up repeatedly in this and other narratives. She moved to Berlin as a young student in the late ’80s and started working at the bar Fischlabor before joining the club Tresor as managing director. Later, she took on the booking at the techno club E-Werk and worked the door at various other clubs before returning to Tresor, where she took over the booking. It was an era of pioneers, discovering uncharted territory, and the emergence of DJing as a new art form. It was about new spaces and raw, physical sound. “At Tresor, I understood for the first time what music and space meant together,&quot; she explains. “There's a track I associate with Tresor called 'Sonic Destroyer' by X-101. The simplicity, this energy, the whole spatial experience can be found in this piece. It makes me think about Aphex Twin's 'Analogue Bubblebath.' That gentle warmth that takes over when you’re all partied out and everything feels like a bubble bath through the smoke machine, cigarette smoke, sweat, and breathing. This is music as a tactile experience.</p>

			<p>According to Dröner, if you have experienced the special synergy created when sound and space converge, then it will never leave you: &quot;This old ruin, its walls, the steel, the stroboscopes, the tangible sound and how it dripped from the ceiling. It was like art.&quot; At Tresor, it took years before they figured out how to create good sound. Most systems were simply overloaded by the low-frequency sub-genres of electronic music like techno, house, jungle, and drum and bass. In the early years of Tresor, the sound clattered in all corners. The quality improved rapidly over the years and culminated in the mid-’90s with the Love Parade parties, which brought rave culture to the streets and even caused local monuments like the Berlin Victory Column to shake from megawatt PAs installed on trucks and millions of ravers dancing in toe. This sound from Berlin eventually became a mass movement and the last great youth culture of the 20th century.
